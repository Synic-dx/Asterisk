# Asterisk

An app to serve IGCSE & A Level MCQ Questions.

## Tech Stack

- MERN with NextJS (TypeScript)
- Formik and Yup for Client Side Validation
- Chakra UI Library for NextJS | For the Minimalistic Flat design desired
- Mongoose + ZOD for extra layer of Server Side Validation
- NextAuthJS, ResendEmail (custom email after domain purchase) for signin authentication (OTP Verification + Google Signin as well)
- ReactEmail for formatting the email to be sent
- BcryptJS for password encryption and matching

## Resources & Planned Features

- Paid Custom Domain + Paid Database to store approx 15k (10 years of 5 subjects) MCQ questions (Physics(2800)+Chemistry(2800)+Biology(2800)+EconomicsIGCSE(2100)+EconomicsALevel(4200))
- Small space to keep user accounts as well, hopefully 50-100 free signups atleast after some Reddit/DC self-promotion (can pay mods to pin the stuff for a week).
- Will host the Questions'/Options' Images in a paid Image hosting CDN (Cloudinary) or hopefully in another Github repository itself, sorted cleanly by subject codes and question numbers/option.
- Images extraction and uploading will have to be manual sadly but can be using better methods to auto-compile pdfs into jsons after extracting away images.
- Explanations will have to be autogenerated by either Meta Llama or OpenAI API dynamically at every submit (as this will be API data sent straight to client side database storage might not be taxed).
- Have to figure out payment mechanism as well, probably some RazorPay API integration, but planning to restrict free users to 2 total subjects, 20 Practice Sums a day, and 2 full mocks a day, and no AI Grader Access (have to see if this works accurately enough at all to be bothered after). Pricing, 'donation', could be $10 for an all access pass forever, to simplify matters to bare minimum. One day of full access will be given to all new users for day.

## Development in Progress
- Signup/Signin Authentication Completed except Google Login
- Some routes and redirections set
