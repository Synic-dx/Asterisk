# Asterisk

An app to serve IGCSE & A Level MCQ Questions.

## Tech Stack

- MERN with NextJS (TypeScript)
- Formik and Yup for Client Side Validation
- Chakra UI Library for NextJS | For the Minimalistic Flat design desired
- Mongoose + ZOD for extra layer of Server Side Validation
- NextAuthJS, ResendEmail (custom email after domain purchase) for signin authentication (OTP Verification)
- ReactEmail for formatting the email to be sent
- BcryptJS for password encryption and matching

## Resources & Planned Features

- Paid Custom Domain + Free MongoDB database to store approx 10k AI generated MCQs (based on actual papers but not copying them, ![CAIE Copyright](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cambridgeinternational.org%2FImages%2F114147-application-copyright-guidance.docx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK) ). Approx storage consumed will be less than 100MB according to Bing AI so will fit in the 512MB free plan.
- Small space to keep user accounts as well, hopefully 50-100 free signups atleast after some Reddit self-promotion (can pay mods to pin the stuff for a week).
- Explanations will have to be autogenerated by either Meta Llama or OpenAI API dynamically at every submit (as this will be API data sent straight to client side database storage might not be taxed).
- Have to figure out payment mechanism as well, probably some RazorPay API integration, but planning to restrict free users to 2 total subjects, 40 Practice Sums a day, and no AI Grader Access (have to see if this works accurately enough at all to be bothered after). Pricing, 'donation', could be $5 for an all access pass forever, to simplify matters to bare minimum. One day of full access will be given to all new users for day, freeAccessValidTill = new Date(UserModel.createdAt + getDay(1)).

## Development in Progress
- Signup/Signin Authentication Completed
